Quick and streamlined vector graphics creator.
Boxy SVG is both simple but powerful, capable of whipping up a quick logo design in minutes or building the most sophisticated digital artwork. Unlike Inkscape or other Linux SVG editors, Boxy SVG uses Chromium's rendering engine for the SVG - the most complete and stable way for making your vector image appear as intended. It is easy to export to PNG, PDF, or numerous other image formats.

All Pi-Apps logos and Botspot branding is made using Boxy SVG, a free tool with an audience of millions.
