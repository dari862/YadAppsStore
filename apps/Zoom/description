Zoom video calls on the Raspberry Pi.
This is the full desktop app, so you can use virtual backgrounds and Gallery View!
This works by running the x86 Zoom Linux app inside the box86/box64 emulator.
Performance is good enough on the Pi4. Turning off HD video in Zoom's settings is recommended.

To run: Menu -> Internet -> Zoom
To run in a terminal: ~/zoom/ZoomLauncher
