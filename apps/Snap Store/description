Snaps are app packages for desktop, cloud and IoT that are easy to install, secure, cross‐platform and dependency‐free.
This makes it easy to find and install Snaps.

Beware that Snap packages can be slow and buggy, especially on Raspberry Pi computers. Many would advise finding non-Snap ways to install apps you use often.

To run: Menu -> Preferences -> Snap Store
To run in a terminal: snap-store
